### Who am I talking to?

I'm Marcel, a physics student, currently at [KIT](http://kit.edu) in Karlsruhe, Germany. I occasionally rant on Twitter [@sirmarcel](http://twitter.com/sirmarcel), and post pictures of food and books to [Instagram](https://instagram.com/sirmarcel). On [Retinacast](http://retinacast.de), I talk about TV, books and movies with some friends. In German. Sorry.

### What are you talking about?

I honestly don't really know what this blog is about. It's just the place where I put stuff online. It started out with blogging about mods for The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, and now it's basically just me chronicling my own obsessions. I like to think it's eclectic.

### And how does it work?

Ah well. So you're *that* kind of person. Splendid!

This site is powered by Octopress, a brilliant piece of software that takes a collection of files (my blog posts) and renders them into a completely static web site. I have written a bit more on Octopress [here](/post/greeting-the-kraken), but if you're *really* interested, you can just check out this blog on [Github](https://github.com/sirmarcel/octolog). After reading my slightly shoddy code, you'll probably understand this site better than I do myself.

The design, lovingly called "octolog" byâ€¦ well, mostly by myself, is very, very loosely based on [Ethan Turkeltaub's](http://ethan.heroku.com/) Octopress theme (I basically tweaked his templates and wrote my own CSS). The fonts are Museo Sans and Museo Slab, two amazing fonts served by [Typekit](http://typekit.com). Some of the design decisions are also laid out in [this blog post](/post/greeting-the-kraken). I have tried to make the theme as forkeable (is that even a word?) as possible, so go have some fun.
