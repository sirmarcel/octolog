Some photos from my summer holiday on the island of [Hvar]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hvar ), which I completely forgot to post for a few months. Maybe they'll help you feel warm in this soggy winter?

{% photo hvar/hvar10; That's Stiller by Max Frisch, one of the summer reads I still haven't finished. It's not the book's fault, though. I'm just easily distracted by other books. %}

{% photo hvar/hvar12; This is a great novella, go read it! %}
{% photo hvar/hvar13 %}
{% photo hvar/hvar14; The island has been inhabited since about 3500 BC. Apparently, the archeologists are quite enthusiastic about that. So am I! %}

{% photo hvar/hvar16; Couldn't resist the good old shallow focus and sunset combo. %}
