A quick announcement for people interested in using this blog's theme: I've built a slightly more... forkeable version of the "octolog" theme. The site name is no longer hard-coded into the templates, my [Mint](http://haveamint.com) tracking code is no longer in the header, there's less site-specific assorted crap, that sort of thing. The readme also contains actually useful information now. That's a change. Take a  closer look [here](https://github.com/sirmarcel/octolog), and have fun.
