I finally got around to watching some of the talks from XOXO, and oh my, they are *delightful*. I spent the evening listening to Cabel Sasser, Marco Arment, Jack Cheng, Vihart, and the core crew of Boing Boing, while manically folding [rhombic dodecahedrons]( http://www.aph.kit.edu/wegener/downloads/F002-RhombicDodecahedron.pdf ) (for SCIENCE!). It was great.
