Exactly what it says on the tin: An exhaustive essay on how realistic combat in space could work. If we ever start fighting our wars in space, it's not going to be romantic and faintly reminiscent of naval warfare; instead it will involve a crapload of nukes and a healthy dose of Newtonian mechanics.
