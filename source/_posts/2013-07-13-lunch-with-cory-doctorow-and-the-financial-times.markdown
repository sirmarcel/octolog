> More remarkable to me than any of this is that [Doctorow] claims to prepare for himself, his wife and five-year-old daughter “a three-to-four-course, hot/cold tailor-made breakfast every morning, in 20 minutes flat, with handmade coffees”. And although I arrive at Hawksmoor 10 minutes early, he’s there already, sipping sparkling water at the bar and reading a book.

A short, very delightful account of eating lunch with Cory Doctorow.

And, yes, I'm currently stuck in a Humble Bundle-induced Doctorow reread-loop, so this just squeezed past any editorial filters I usually have on this blog.
