I’ve been enjoying [Tony Zhou’s](http://vimeo.com/tonyzhou) videos “dedicated to the analysis of film form” for a while. This one was so good, I just had to link to it here. In it, Tony concisely and elegantly explores how text messaging and the internet are represented in movies. This is a rather new problem, and it’s fascinating to watch how filmmakers are slowly learning how to solve it in an aesthetically pleasing way.

You should also totally watch [Noah](http://vimeo.com/81257262), a short film that also makes a quick appearance in the video. *Noah* takes place entirely on a teenager’s computer screen, and yet it manages to tell a compelling story.
