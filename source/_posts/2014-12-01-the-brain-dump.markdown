> Because we are open-source freaks, no cash, also no real jobs, we settle inside dead rubber-tyre factory where we "borrow" electricity from local nuke plant. We listen to streaming techno and metal, coding a lot, smoking cannabis and never go into a church. So we are called "decadent" by repressive Russian-Orthodox militia of Donetsk Peoples Republic. Not looking good.

Bruce Sterling, with a present-day cyberpunk short story for [Terraform](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/terraform-home-online-fiction), Vice’s new science fiction project. Their call for submissions is pretty great:

> We're looking for 2,000 words or fewer—a nice, digestible internet length—of speculative fiction honing in on the tech, science, and future culture topics driving the zeitgeist. We're looking especially for nearer-future fiction; think more sentient chat bots or climate-changed dystopias and less far-flung space operas. And we don't care what form it comes in: Classic-style SF short stories, social media posts from beyond the horizon, fictive data dumps, experimental graphic narratives, and so on.

I can’t wait to see what else they’re going to publish. Their most recent story, [One Day, I Will Die on Mars](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/one-day-i-will-die-on-mars) is also just delightfully insane.
