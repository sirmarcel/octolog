> Blackbar is a text game: a sci-fi story of a dystopian future told through the medium of word puzzles.

Blackbar is a great little game, a brilliant idea perfectly executed. It also gets fiendishly hard very quickly, but the story is a great motivation to keep playing.

First [Gone Home]( http://www.gonehomegame.com ), now this. What a great week.
