Film Critic Hulk is quickly becoming one of my favourite writers on the internet, and this essay has played a large role in that. It's his mission statement for the movie columns he writes for Badass Digest. He quite eloquently–despite his caps lock obsession and hulk-speak–explains why nobody should ever hate a movie: It doesn't lead to interesting conversation, and it's an intellectual dead end. The fact that he got this idea from Quentin Tarantino makes it even more relevant.

This approach isn't limited to film, of course. Unequivocally hating any piece of culture is mostly a waste of time, it's far more interesting and rewarding to ponder the reasons behind disliking something. The extreme version of this is instinctively disregarding entire new mediums or genres, which is a shortcut to becoming an incredibly tedious person. Nobody likes the guy that just scowls when you mention video games or hip hop.

Anyway, where was I? Ah, the essay. It's great, go read it. But be warned: It kind of makes you want to absorb a lot of culture, which might be inconvenient if you're planning on being productive today. Except if you consider that kind of thing productive. Which it probably is.
