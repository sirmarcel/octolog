> Rather than say: “I am too busy, I don’t have any time for X.” I realize I can be honest and say I am not interested enough in X to do it.
> EVERYONE has a lot of stuff to do because there IS a lot of stuff to do. Some of it is work. Some of it is hanging out with your family. Some of it is just laying on the couch reading a book.

This is a thought that has been on my mind a lot in the last few months: Everybody has exactly the same 1400 minutes a day to spend, and it's your responsibility to fill these few hours with activities you consider rewarding.
