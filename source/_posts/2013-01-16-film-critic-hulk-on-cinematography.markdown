> CINEMA IS A LANGUAGE AND THE WAY WE USE IT, INVERT IT AND COMMUNICATE WITH IT IS EVERYTHING. AND WITH THAT UNDERSTANDING YOU CAN STRETCH THE LIMITS OF CINEMA, TEST THE BOUNDARIES OF ART AND JUXTAPOSE STORY AND MEANING AND THEMES AND SYMBOLS AND SHAPE OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE NAME OF SOMETHING BETTER. TO OUR HIGHEST POSSIBLE SELVES.

Probably the best thing in all caps I have ever read. A brilliant introduction to cinematography, delivered under the pretence of arguing why *Les MisÃ©rables* is not a very good movie. It's insanely quotable:

> AND WHEN YOU TRULY UNDERSTAND CINEMA YOU CAN TAKE THAT INVENTIVENESS TO AMAZING NEW PLACES. YOU CAN MAKE A REFLEXIVE WESTERN SLAVE REVENGE FILM IN THE SOUTH THAT'S TECHNICALLY PART OF A SERIES OF ITALIAN FILMS.

Okay, I got to go watch *Django Unchained* now. You go read this essay first.
