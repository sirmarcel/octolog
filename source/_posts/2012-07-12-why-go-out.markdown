> Why go out? Because if what we want more than anything is to attain self-confidence, health, energy, and peace of mind, we should stay in. We could be like little Buddhas, meditating and masturbating and watching TV. And we could imagine ourselves to be brilliant, and kind, and good lecturers, and good listeners, and utterly loving -- and thereâ€™d be no way to prove it otherwise.

One of those essay that are so true, so brilliant, they almost hurt.
