> People currently think of text as information to be consumed. I want text to be an environment to think in.

Bret Victor, who you might know from [this amazing talk]( http://vimeo.com/36579366 ), has outlined some of his ideas for the future of text in [this blog post]( http://worrydream.com/#!/ExplorableExplanations ). Now, he has implemented some of them in the redesign of a well-known paper on network theory. It is nothing short of amazing, how just a few interactive elements make the paper much easier to read and understand. This kind of thing would have been very useful indeed in dealing with the physics textbooks I read last semester...
