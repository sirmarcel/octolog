For a few weeks now, Boing Boing has been publishing an essay series titled ["Enthralling Books"]( http://boingboing.net/tag/enthralling-books ) about–as the title subtly suggests–books the different writers found particularly interesting and/or life-changing. I haven't gotten around to reading all of them yet–books and essays alike–but I really liked the ones I *have* read. Especially this one about Philip K. Dick's "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?".
