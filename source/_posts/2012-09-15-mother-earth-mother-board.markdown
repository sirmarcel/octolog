> [...] Bell and Kelvin, the two supreme ninja hacker mage lords of global telecommunications, have formed an alliance to challenge AT&T and all the other old monopolies.

Any article that calls brilliant scientists "mage lords" deserves being read. If it's a sprawling and incredibly good report by Neal Stephenson on the laying of an undersea fiber-optic cable, even more so. 

Seriously though, this might just be the best piece of non-fiction that has ever crossed my desk. I love pieces like this, that show our world in an entirely new, distinctly science-fiction light. It's amazing what kind of interesting, weird stories lurk behind the infrastructure we use every day without ever thinking about it.

While reading this, I couldn't help but think about Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels. In some of the later books, the "clacks", a semaphore-based communication system, play an increasingly large role. The stories he tells about building the semaphore towers have the same... well, *feeling*. It's always about building the best platform possible, in the face of insanely difficult obstacles. And reading about this quest for perfection is a truly a treat.
