*Back in the land of the living, clutching a bachelor's certificate to my chest, panting.*

Here's an [examination of the ideology underlying Pixar movies](http://www.theawl.com/2015/07/the-pixar-theory-of-labor) on *The Awl*:

> In every Pixar film, the protagonist’s arc is oriented toward the ultimate goal of being an efficient, productive worker—whether employment has been thematized as being a father, princess, robot janitor, toy, ant colonist, harvester of screams, adventurer in South America, or otherwise. 

Incidentally, *The Verge* recently published a delightful [profile of *The Awl*](http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/9/8908279/the-awl-profile-choire-sicha-john-herrman-matt-buchanan), which not only gives a clear-eyed survey of the current media landscape, but also contains gems like this:

> It’s really a giant lesbian Australian socialized collective with capitalism in the mix in a really gross way.

The community on Tumblr has apparently started evolving [its own linguistic conventions](http://seldo.tumblr.com/post/123601158505/staff-prismatic-bell-atomicairspace).

Now that free time is a thing in my life again, I started reading the *Southern Reach* trilogy. It's nice and mysterious and creepy, like a less high-octane nightmare fuel version of [Liminal States](http://liminalstates.com). I'm also reading *Aristoi*, but it's a bit hard to parse all the neologisms.

After refusing to even admit that *vlog* is an actual word for years, I finally got around to watching [Casey Neistat's](https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat/videos). I'm still struggling to make sense of it all.

[Beme](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/17/the-debut-of-beme-a-social-app-that-aims-for-authenticity/) is strangely amusing; I'm sirmarcel there. (The article is fun too, with its barely contained undertone of "what the *hell* are those kids up to today?")
