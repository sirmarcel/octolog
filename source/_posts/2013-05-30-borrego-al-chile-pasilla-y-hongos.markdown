Stumbled upon this dish in Neven Mrgan's Flickr stream ([here]( http://www.flickr.com/photos/neven/7791340344/ )), found a recipe, made it with a friend, loved it. Serving cheese with this chili is a brilliant suggestion, it quite nicely balances out the spiciness. Also made [these flour tortillas]( http://allrecipes.com/recipe/homemade-flour-tortillas/?scale=6&ismetric=1 ), can't complain about those either.
