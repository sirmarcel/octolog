Miniphonic is a little Ruby wrapper around the API for the audio processing service [Auphonic]( https://auphonic.com ). It started out as a part of [Podding]( https://github.com/Podding/Podding ), a podcast CMS a friend and I are working on, but it's a (very small) standalone project now.

Writing software in Ruby is fun!
