Taken last year on vacation with [pfleidi]( https://twitter.com/pfleidi ). We picked a windy, slightly rainy day for our trip to Brighton and consequently had the pier almost to ourselves. There's something magical about this empty, rusting theme park out on the sea. It almost feels like a discarded movie set.
