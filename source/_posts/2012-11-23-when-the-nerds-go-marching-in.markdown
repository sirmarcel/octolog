An excellent report on the Obama campaign's tech staff. My favourite part is probably the short profile on Harper Reed, the campaign CTO who has a fascinating motto:
> "I always look like a fucking idiot," Reed told me. "And if you look like an asshole, you have to be really good."

I haven't got much more to say, it's just an interesting, well-written piece of reporting. Not that easy to come by, these days...

For a bit more information on the insane amount of quantitative analysis involved in managing a presidential campaign, you should also take a look at [this piece]( http://swampland.time.com/2012/11/07/inside-the-secret-world-of-quants-and-data-crunchers-who-helped-obama-win/print/ "Time Magazine on the analytics behind the Obama campaign" ) from Time Magazine.
