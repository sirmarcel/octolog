If you keep track of the via links in my posts, you will notice that I'm an avid reader of [Boing Boing]( http://boingboing.net ). This article details how the blog works behind the scenes, how money is made (ads) and how the posts are curated (eclectically). Fascinating stuff. I love that Boing Boing refuses to turn into a Gawker-esque media empire and *still* manages to be one of the most read sites on the internet. There's still room for weirdness out there...
