> Now we all check their email (or Twitter, or Facebook, or Instagram, or...) compulsively at the dinner table, or the traffic light. Now we all stow our devices on the nightstand before bed, and check them first thing in the morning. We all do. It's not abnormal, and it's not just for business. It's just what people do. Like smoking in 1965, it's just life.

I wonder how this phone-checking tic will play out in the next few years. Maybe augmented reality will make it obsolete? Or rather, less noticeable? Personally, I kind of hope for a bit of a backlash against it. You know, people checking their phone while talking to you is *annoying*. (And yeah, I'm guilty of occasionally doing that myself. I'm not proud.)
